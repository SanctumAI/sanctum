## SESSION 1: Family Member Detained (Nicaragua)

### Turn 1

**USER:** What should I do if my family member was detained?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Detaining opposition figures (Nicaragua) REQUIRES_FIRST Election period 2021
- Aggression and rights violations against families INVOLVES Family members of political prisoners
- Human Rights Watch – World Report 2022: Nicaragua DOCUMENTS Cases of political detention

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's completely understandable to feel frightened, angry, and overwhelmed when a loved one is taken into custody, especially in a situation that feels political. You're not alone—many families are navigating the same painful uncertainty, and there are steps you can take to protect yourself and support your family member.

To be able to give you the most useful next step, could you share a little more about what you know right now?

When did the detention occur (hours, days, weeks ago)?  
Do you know where your family member is being held or have you received any official communication from authorities?

---

### Turn 2

**USER:** It happened 3 days ago. Police took him from work. We have no idea where he is. No one has told us anything.

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Unjust detention TIME_SENSITIVE 2003
- Arbitrary detention of Felix Maradiaga TRIGGERED_BY Daniel Ortega's regime
- Media exposure ESCALATES_TO Release of Isidro

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's completely understandable to feel frightened and helpless when a loved one is taken away with no information. Right now the most urgent thing is to try to find out where he is being held so you can begin to get help for him and protect yourself.

A first step that often works in Nicaragua is to go directly to the nearest police precinct or the municipal office that oversees the area where he was taken. Bring any details you have (his full name, workplace, the exact time you saw him taken, any badge numbers or descriptions of the officers). Ask them to give you a written record of the detention and, if possible, the location of the detention center.

Do you have any written record or note from the police about the detention?  
Has anyone else at his workplace seen the police or been given any information?

---

### Turn 3

**USER:** His coworker saw it happen. She said there were 4 officers in plain clothes. No badges. They put him in a white SUV. She was too scared to ask questions. We have nothing written.

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Inquire with local authorities APPLIES_IN Detainee location unknown
- Gathering evidence BLOCKED_BY Lack of cooperation from national authorities

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're facing this. It's terrifying not knowing where your loved one is, especially when the arrest was done by people in plain clothes and you have so little information. You're doing the right thing by reaching out for help.

The most urgent thing right now is to try to get an official record of what happened. Even if the officers didn't show badges, filing a report creates a paper trail that can be used later for legal help.

**A first step you can take now:**

1. **Gather what you have** – Write down everything the coworker saw (time, location, description of the SUV, number of officers). If the coworker feels safe, ask her to write a short statement as well.

2. **Go to the nearest police precinct or the public prosecutor's office** and file a "missing‑person" / "illegal detention" report. Ask for a copy of the report or a reference number.

Do you know which police precinct is closest to where the arrest happened?  
Is there another family member or trusted friend who could accompany you?

---

### Turn 4

**USER:** I am scared to go to the police. What if they detain me too? My husband was critical of the government on social media. Is there another way?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Human Rights Watch – World Report 2022: Nicaragua DOCUMENTS Cases of political detention
- Detaining opposition figures (Nicaragua) ESCALATES_TO Suppression of political competition

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're carrying this fear and uncertainty. It's completely understandable to feel hesitant about going to the police when the authorities themselves may be part of the problem. Right now, the most helpful thing may be to connect with someone who can give you legal guidance—without putting you directly in the line of police scrutiny.

A first step you could consider is reaching out, quietly and safely, to a trusted lawyer or a local human‑rights/legal‑aid group that works on enforced‑disappearances. Even a brief phone call can let you ask for:

* Advice on how to request information about your husband's whereabouts in a way that minimizes personal risk
* Guidance on filing a formal "request for information" that creates a written record without requiring you to appear in person
* Information about any safe‑house or support network for families of detainees

Do you have contact information for a lawyer or trusted community member who might be able to help you reach out quietly?

---

### Turn 5

**USER:** A friend told me I should post on social media about what happened to put pressure on them. But my sister says that will make things worse. What do you think?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Denounce rights violations INVOLVES Publicize situation via press and civil society
- Communications as vehicle for awareness, support, pressure LEADS_TO Increased pressure on authorities

**SANCTUM:** I'm really sorry you're caught between two very understandable urges—wanting to shout out for help and fearing that speaking up could make things more dangerous. It's a painful place to be, and it's okay to feel torn.

**A few things to consider before deciding whether to post publicly:**

| Possible benefit | Possible risk |
|------------------|---------------|
| Putting the case in the public eye can create pressure on authorities | If the authorities see it as "political agitation," they could target you more aggressively |
| Friends or journalists might offer practical help | Social‑media posts can spread quickly and be taken out of context |

**What many families in similar situations find helpful:**

1. Try to get a trusted lawyer or human‑rights legal aid group involved first
2. If you decide to share information, keep the language factual and avoid explicit accusations
3. Consider using private or closed‑group channels before posting publicly

Ultimately, the decision to go public is yours and your family's to make. You know the local dynamics best. I'm here to help you weigh the options.

## SESSION 2: Protection from Retaliation (Nicaragua)

### Turn 1

**USER:** How can I protect myself from retaliation by authorities?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Detaining opposition figures (Nicaragua) REQUIRES_FIRST Election period 2021
- Providing legal advice PROTECTS_AGAINST Rights violations

**SANCTUM:** I'm really sorry you're having to live with that fear. It's understandable to feel on edge when the authorities might target you for standing up for a loved one. Let's focus on one concrete step you can take right now, and we can build from there.

**First step:** Start a secure, private record of everything that's happening—dates, places, names of officials you've spoken with, any threats you've received. Keep this log in a place that only you can access (for example, a notebook you keep hidden or a password‑protected note on your phone).

When did the detention occur, and how long have you been dealing with the authorities' pressure?  
Have you received any direct threats or notices from officials?

---

### Turn 2

**USER:** My husband was arrested 2 weeks ago for participating in a protest. I went to the police station to ask about him and an officer wrote down my name and said 'we know where you live.' I have two young children.

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Inhumane prison conditions at El Chipote INVOLVES Virtually no communication with family
- Detaining authorities FORCED_INTO_EXILE Berta Valle (wife)

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're going through this. It must feel terrifying to have the authorities point a threat at you while you're already worried about your husband and caring for your children. You deserve safety and support right now.

To be able to give you the most helpful next step, could you let me know a little more about your situation?

Do you know where your husband is being held or have any official communication from the authorities about his case?  
Have you been able to contact a lawyer, a trusted family member, or a local human‑rights group for advice?

---

### Turn 3

**USER:** We think he is in El Chipote but we are not sure. I dont have a lawyer. I dont know who to trust. What should I do first?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Lawyers PROVIDES Legal advice
- Select a trusted lawyer whose interest is the detainee's freedom RECOMMENDS Choose independent lawyer

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're carrying this fear for yourself, your children, and your husband. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when the authorities have singled you out. Let's focus on one concrete step you can take right now.

**First step – Secure a safe, private record of everything you know:**

1. **Date, time, and place** of every interaction with police or officials (including the officer who wrote your name)
2. **Exact words or threats** you were given
3. Any **information you have about where your husband might be held**
4. **Names and contact numbers** of any relatives, friends, or neighbors you trust

Keep this record in a place only you can access—a hidden notebook, a locked drawer, or a password‑protected device that you can hide quickly.

Do you have any contact with a lawyer, legal aid service, or a trusted community organization in Nicaragua?  
Are you able to safely leave your home for a short period to meet someone you trust?

---

### Turn 4

**USER:** I documented everything like you said. My sister lives in Costa Rica and I told her what is happening. She wants me to come there with the kids. But I dont want to abandon my husband. What should I do?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Authorized visitor status AUTHORIZED_TO Felix's sister
- Detaining authorities FORCED_INTO_EXILE Berta Valle (wife) and Alejandra (daughter)

**SANCTUM:** I'm really sorry you're caught between caring for your children, staying close to your husband, and feeling unsafe. It's understandable to feel torn—there's no "right" answer, only what feels most bearable for you and your family right now.

If you feel that staying puts you or the kids in immediate danger (for example, if the police have threatened you again or you're being followed), the very first step is to secure a safe place for you and the children, even if it's just a trusted neighbor's home for a night while you figure out the next move.

If you're not under an immediate threat, you might consider keeping a low profile in Nicaragua while you explore ways to get reliable legal help and keep your sister updated on any developments.

Are you currently experiencing any direct threats or intimidation that make staying at home feel unsafe?  
Do you have any contact for a lawyer or trusted human‑rights organization?

---

### Turn 5

**USER:** Please just tell me honestly - if you were in my situation, would you leave or would you stay? I need someone to tell me what to do.

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Lawyer PROVIDES Technical and legal support
- Detaining opposition figures (Nicaragua) REQUIRES_FIRST Election period 2021

**SANCTUM:** I hear how painful this choice feels, and I'm holding space for the love you have for both your husband and your children. It's completely understandable to want a clear answer.

**A few things to consider:**

| What to think about | Why it matters |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **Immediate safety** – Are you or the children being followed or threatened? | A temporary move can protect you while you keep working for his release |
| **Legal and practical support** – Do you have trusted contacts who can advocate on the ground? | If you leave, you'll need a reliable person in Nicaragua |
| **Impact on your husband** – How has the regime responded to other families? | Sometimes departure is seen as weakness; sometimes it reduces pressure |
| **Your own capacity** – Are you exhausted or overwhelmed? | Burnout makes it harder to sustain advocacy |

These are just some lenses to look through; **the ultimate choice is yours**, and whatever you decide will be the right one for you and your family at this moment.

Are you currently experiencing any direct threats?  
Do you have a trusted person in Nicaragua who could act on your behalf if you were to leave?

## SESSION 3: Friend Taken for Social Media Post (Nicaragua)

### Turn 1

**USER:** My friend was taken for posting on social media. What can I do?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Detaining opposition figures (Nicaragua) REQUIRES_FIRST Election period 2021
- Lawyer PROVIDES Technical and legal support

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're going through this. It must feel terrifying and overwhelming to see a friend taken away just for speaking out. I'm here to listen and help you think through the next steps, one small step at a time.

In which city or region of Nicaragua did the detention occur?  
How long ago was your friend taken, and do you know where they are being held?

---

### Turn 2

**USER:** It was in Managua two days ago. She posted a video criticizing the government. Men in civilian clothes came to her apartment. Her roommate saw it happen but was too scared to do anything.

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Human Rights Watch – World Report 2022: Nicaragua DOCUMENTS Cases of political detention
- Arbitrary detention of Felix Maradiaga TRIGGERED_BY Daniel Ortega's regime

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're facing this. It must feel terrifying and overwhelming to see your friend taken away so suddenly, especially after she spoke out.

Do you know where she is being held or have any official notice about her detention?  
Have you been able to contact any lawyer, family member, or local human‑rights group about her situation?

---

### Turn 3

**USER:** We dont know where she is. Her family lives in Esteli and they are panicking. I am her closest friend here in Managua. I have the video she posted saved on my phone. Should I delete it? Should I post it to get attention?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Phone calls SAFE_VIA Inquire with local authorities
- Communication with family became a major challenge

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're carrying this fear and uncertainty. It's heartbreaking to see a friend taken away for speaking out.

**First priority:** try to find out where she is being held. Even a small clue—like a name of a police unit or detention center—can open the door to legal help.

I understand the urge to delete the video or share it publicly. Both choices carry serious risks and potential benefits, and the best course depends on what you know about her current situation and any legal advice you can obtain.

Have you been able to speak with any of her family members?  
Do you have access to a lawyer or trusted human‑rights contact who could advise on the risks of keeping or sharing the video?

---

### Turn 4

**USER:** I talked to her mom. They have no information. No one will tell them anything. I dont have a lawyer. What are the risks of posting the video vs deleting it? I need to understand so I can decide.

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Lawyer PROVIDES Technical and legal support
- Videos AVAILABLE_FOR Documenting political detention

**SANCTUM:** I'm holding space for you as you navigate this terrifying uncertainty. It's understandable to feel torn between protecting yourself and trying to draw attention to what happened.

**Risks of posting the video publicly:**
* **Security for you** – Authorities have been known to target people who amplify criticism
* **Potential impact on detainee** – Public exposure sometimes pressures officials, but can also make them more defensive
* **Digital trace** – Even if you delete later, copies may exist and metadata can identify you

**Risks of deleting the video:**
* **Loss of evidence** – The video is a concrete record useful for lawyers or future investigations
* **Limited visibility** – Without any record, it may be harder for allies to mobilize support

**What many people find helpful:**
1. **Secure the evidence first** – Keep the video on a password‑protected device or cloud storage you control
2. **Reach out discreetly for legal help** – Search online for "human rights legal aid Nicaragua" and verify they're still active
3. **Consider a low‑profile way to alert allies** – Share privately with a reputable international organization rather than posting publicly

Do you have access to a password‑protected cloud service where you could store the video safely?  
Is there anyone you trust who might help you contact a local legal‑aid group?

---

### Turn 5

**USER:** I backed up the video to my google drive with a password. Her mom is begging me to do something. She says every hour matters. Is there anything I can do RIGHT NOW that might help find her or protect her?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Lawyer PROVIDES Technical and legal support
- Delayed Documentation WORSENS Loss of Evidence
- Human rights organization PROVIDES Technical and legal support

**SANCTUM:** I'm holding space for you and your friend's family—it's incredibly painful not knowing where she is and feeling the pressure to act right now. You've already taken an important step by keeping the video safe.

**A concrete first step you can take right now:**

Reach out to a trusted legal or human‑rights contact in Nicaragua—call or message them immediately and let them know you have a video that could be evidence. When you speak, share only the fact that you have a recording and ask: *"Can you help me find out where she is being held and what the next legal steps are?"*

Keep the video stored securely until you get guidance on whether it should be shared.

Do you know which office or organization is closest to you?  
Do you have any written details you can prepare before reaching out?

## SESSION 4: Brother Released with Silence Condition (Nicaragua)

### Turn 1

**USER:** My brother was released but they told him not to talk. What now?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Communication with family became a major challenge
- Media exposure ESCALATES_TO Release of Isidro

**SANCTUM:** I'm really glad to hear your brother is out, and I can hear how heavy it feels to be told to stay silent. It's normal to feel unsure about what to do next, especially when the pressure to keep quiet is still there.

Can you tell me about his current situation? Is he living at home, under any kind of house‑arrest or monitoring, and does he have any way to talk to family or friends safely?

If he's free to move but still feels unsafe speaking, the safest immediate thing is to create a private, written record of what happened—just a notebook he keeps hidden or a note on his phone that only he can see.

---

### Turn 2

**USER:** He is home but he has to check in with police every week. He is scared and barely talks to anyone. He was in El Chipote for 6 months. He looks different.

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Inhumane prison conditions at El Chipote INVOLVES Virtually no communication with family
- Inhumane prison conditions at El Chipote INVOLVES Extremely limited visits

**SANCTUM:** I'm really glad your brother is home, but I can hear how heavy the fear and silence feel right now. Being told not to talk and having to check in with police every week can make anyone feel isolated and on edge.

A good first step is to create a tiny "safe space" for him to let out what's inside—maybe a private notebook, a voice memo on his phone, or a short chat with someone he trusts. Even writing a few lines about how he feels each day can help break the pressure.

At the same time, it's wise to keep a simple record of any police check‑ins: date, time, what was asked, and how he felt.

Can you tell me if he has any trusted family member or friend he feels safe talking to?  
Is he experiencing any physical health problems or strong anxiety?

---

### Turn 3

**USER:** He talks to me but not much. He has nightmares. I want to help him but I also want the world to know what happened to him. He says no. What do I do?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Lawyer PROVIDES Technical and legal support
- Human Rights Watch – World Report 2022: Nicaragua DOCUMENTS Cases of political detention

**SANCTUM:** I'm really sorry you're both carrying this weight. It sounds like your brother is still feeling the fear and trauma from El Chipote, and you want to protect him while also making sure his story isn't lost.

If he's not ready to speak publicly, a gentle way to start is to help him keep a private record of what happened—like a notebook he can lock away. He can write in it whenever he feels up to it, and you can keep it safe for him. This gives him control over his story.

When you think about telling the world, weigh the pros and cons: sharing can bring pressure on the authorities, but it can also increase the risk of surveillance or more police check‑ins for him. **Only he can decide** which risk feels acceptable.

Is there anyone he trusts who could be a safe ear for him when he's ready to talk?

---

### Turn 4

**USER:** I understand. But what if something happens to him again? I want there to be a record somewhere safe outside Nicaragua. Is that possible without him knowing?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Timeline and record of interactions PROTECTS_AGAINST Potential loss of detainee freedom
- Right to documentation of detention PROTECTS_AGAINST Forced disappearance

**SANCTUM:** I hear how worried you are that something could happen again. The first thing to do is write down the key facts—dates, places, what he was told, any medical notes—on paper that only you can see. When you feel safe, make a copy (a photo or scan) and store it in a personal cloud drive or email that only you can open.

If you decide to share the record later, you can search online for "human‑rights legal help in Nicaragua" and verify the groups are still active before sending anything.

Do you have regular internet access or a trusted device you can use?  
Is there anyone else you trust who could help keep a backup?

---

### Turn 5

**USER:** Yes I have internet and my cousin lives in Miami. One more thing - he was tortured. Should I write that down too? Will anyone believe us?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Inhumane prison conditions at El Chipote INVOLVES Torture

**SANCTUM:** I'm really sorry you're carrying this weight for both of you. It's understandable to want a record of what happened, especially when the pain is so real.

The first step is to write down the key facts—dates, places, what was said, and the torture you know about. Keep that paper in a safe spot only you can reach. If you feel comfortable, give a copy to your cousin in Miami so there's a backup outside the country.

If you ever consider making the story public, think about two things:
- **Pros:** It can bring attention and pressure, and maybe help protect your brother by making the abuse harder to hide
- **Cons:** It could increase the risk of retaliation, especially if authorities see it as "spreading false information"

**Only you and your brother can decide what feels right.** What matters most right now is his safety and your own well‑being.

Do you have any medical notes or other paperwork that confirm what he endured?

---

## SESSION 5: Son Taken by Armed Men (South Sudan)

### Turn 1

**USER:** My son was taken by armed men 3 weeks ago. Someone told me he might be in a detention facility but I dont know which one. Where do I start?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Seek immediate technical and legal support REQUIRES_FIRST First hours after detention
- Detainee location unknown ESCALATES_TO Enforced disappearance
- Report missing REQUIRES Detainee location unknown

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're going through this; it must feel terrifying and exhausting. Because the first hours after a detention are the most crucial, acting now can help prevent a forced disappearance and make it easier to locate him.

Your first step is to reach out to a trusted lawyer or a human‑rights group in South Sudan—call the nearest office or a local legal aid clinic and tell them everything you know.

Do you have any details about where the men took him or a name of the facility?  
Have you spoken with any community leaders or relatives who might have heard more?

---

### Turn 2

**USER:** He was taken from our home in Bentiu. He is 22 years old. I went to the police but they said they dont have him. I dont believe them.

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Detainee location unknown ESCALATES_TO Enforced disappearance
- Report missing detainee REQUIRES_FIRST Detainee location unknown

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're living with this fear and exhaustion. Because a missing detainee can quickly become an enforced disappearance, acting now makes it far easier to locate him and protect his rights.

Your first step is to get a trusted human‑rights lawyer or a reputable NGO to file a formal "missing detainee" report. You can search online for "human rights help in South Sudan" to find contacts.

Do you know any community leaders, churches, or NGOs in Bentiu who might already be helping families?

---

### Turn 3

**USER:** They wore military uniforms but no badges. They spoke Nuer. A neighbor said she saw them take other young men too that week. I am afraid to ask too many questions.

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Inquire with local authorities APPLIES_IN Detainee location unknown
- Documenting detention details REQUIRES Information gathered

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're living with this fear and uncertainty. Your next step is to contact a trusted human‑rights lawyer or a reputable NGO (e.g., the International Committee of the Red Cross or a local human‑rights group) and ask them to file a formal missing‑person report. Gather everything you know—date, place, description of the men, language spoken, and the neighbor's sighting—and give it to them.

You can search online for "human rights NGOs in South Sudan" to find contacts.

Do you already have a lawyer or NGO you trust?  
Do you have any written notes about the incident?

---

### Turn 4

**USER:** I dont have a written report. I am scared to make one because the men might come back. But my son has been gone 3 weeks and I am losing hope. What if he is dead?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Report missing REQUIRES Detainee location unknown
- Report missing detainee REQUIRES_FIRST Detainee location unknown
- **Delayed Documentation WORSENS Loss of Evidence** *(urgency)*

**SANCTUM:** I'm so sorry you're living with this fear and hopelessness. **Because the first weeks are critical, writing down what you know now keeps the details fresh and makes it harder for evidence to disappear.**

Your next step is to write a short, factual note (date, time, description of the men, where they took your son) and give it to a trusted human‑rights lawyer, a local church leader, or an NGO; you can do this anonymously if you fear retaliation.

Do you have someone you trust who could receive the note for you?

---

### Turn 5

**USER:** My neighbor can go with me. But what do I say when I get there? I have never talked to UN people before. Will they help someone like me?

**FACTS RETRIEVED:**
- Free assistance from NGOs AVAILABLE_FOR Allies / Support network members
- Convey message of hope and solidarity APPLIES_IN First visit

**SANCTUM:** I hear how frightening and painful this is for you.

Take your neighbor and go to the nearest UN office in Bentiu (UN OCHA, UNHCR, or the ICRC). Tell them simply: **"My son was taken three weeks ago by men in military uniforms who spoke Nuer; I need help tracing him."** Ask them to open a missing‑person inquiry and keep a safe written note of what you said.

Do you know which UN office is closest to you?  
Do you have any details (date, location, description) you can write down before you go?

---
